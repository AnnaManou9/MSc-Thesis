# MSc-Thesis
Sample scripts of the Master's thesis project in the University of Copenhagen. The projects included loading and plotting .fits files and spectroscopic data from telescopes like ALMA and JWST. The data and online catalogues were used to do stastical analysis, spectra modelling, and to create moment maps to study the kinematics of the targets.
